Also, you can sort in solr by term frequency:

termfreq(text, 'install'), termfreq(metadata, 'image')      - in the fl field to show the actual calculated score
or in the sort field followed by 'asc' or 'desc'

setup solr suggester: https://solr.apache.org/guide/6_6/suggester.html (create a rust endpoint)
(to test the suggester:
curl http://localhost:8983/solr/querty/suggest\?suggest\=true\&suggest.build\=true\&suggest.dictionary\=mySuggester\&wt\=json\&suggest.q\=te
)
Don't forget to build the index! (you build it by making a request with .../?suggest.build=true) You don't have to build it every time you query the suggester, but it should always be ran initially at least once.
Also right now the suggester fails for words with length < 2. It is probably because the suggester has a LengthFilterFactory that limits the length of words between 2 and 255.

spellchecker (firts try /suggest and if it does not return anything (or returns too few items) try /spell)

Also, maybe better logging.

there is only javascript in the google.com body/text solr field
