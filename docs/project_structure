The website crawler and website ranking system are implemented in Rust.
Maybe an HTTP REST API can be used to change the ranks of websites (https://rocket.rs/).
It should only be used internally when users upvote or downvote a website to crawl the website, change its rank, and update its information in solr and the database (only if the website has not been crawled in the last 30 minutes/1 hour/1 day (?))

Website classification is in classifier/

Use OAuth2 for authentication.
Public REST API should be implemented in something robust and reliable (maybe Spring/Spring Boot or Nodejs with express)
